# Purity AI - Hiring Automation Platform

Purity AI is an AI-driven hiring automation platform designed to streamline recruitment by evaluating candidates based on their resumes, experience, and answers to specific questionnaires. With the help of AI, recruiters can search for candidates based on specific job requirements and receive ranked results of suitable matches. This project leverages Next.js for the full-stack web framework and Python for AI processing.

## Features

- **Automated Resume Parsing**: Extracts key information from resumes using an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
- **Questionnaire-Based Evaluation**: Allows candidates to complete aptitude and experience-based questionnaires.
- **Recruiter Search**: Recruiters can query candidates based on job-specific criteria and experience, with ranked results based on candidate suitability.
- **Automatic Notifications**: Monthly or periodic reminders for candidates to update their profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Backend**: Python (AI processing), REST API endpoints
- **Database**: TBD (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
