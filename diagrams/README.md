# **Diagrams Directory**

This folder contains various design and modeling diagrams created for the project. The diagrams are stored in `.drawio` format, which can be opened and edited using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or its compatible tools. Exported images in `.jpg` format are also included for quick reference where applicable.
